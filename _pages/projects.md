<p>This is my final master project with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=zzLBKmgAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate">Dr. Michael Brendam</a> at King's College London. This project evaluates the potential of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to learn the distribution of 3D structures. Then, use the learned ditributions to generate new data with the intrinsic characteristics of the original source. We show that is possible to improve the classification of 3D human representations by generating extra data using 3D GANs. Potential application of our findings lies on better human action detection systems for autonomous systems and improving the analysis of 3D medical data.</p>

<p>This project involves a literature review in the area of explainable Artificial Intelligence that I made for the module "advanced research topics" with  <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=JSARf0MAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate">Dr. Sanjay Modgil</a> at King's College London. Our focus was to report a comprehensive review of the trends and development in explainable Artificial Intelligence. So, other researchers can use this review as a starting point to develop explainable AI tools. </p>
