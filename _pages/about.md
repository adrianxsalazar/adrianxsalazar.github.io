Hello !! This is the web page of Adrian Salazar Gomez

## Me in a Nutshell
I am a research assistant in Machine Learning and Robotic Perception at the [University of Lincoln](https://www.lincoln.ac.uk/home/). Besides, I do research in collaboration with [King's College London](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/) and I am a teaching assistant at [King's College London](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/) for the Data Mining and Machine Learning modules.

## Research
My research interests lie broadly within artificial intelligence, machine learning, and autonomous systems.

Lately, I've been working on:
* Anomaly and out-of-distribution detection
* Computer vision for agricultural robots
* Uncertainty & Robustness in Deep Learning
* Coolaborative robots
